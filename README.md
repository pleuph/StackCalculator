# StackCalculator

## Purpose
Make a simple stack calculator, using reverse polish notation, in Unity. Must be able to receive an input and give an output. Having a polished UI is not important. Architecture, error handling etc. sould be well considered. 

### Acceptance criteria
- Make a simple stack calculator in unity 
- Support most basic operations +, -, *, /
- Should be able to run on a mobile device (iOS, Android)
- At every 10th calculation, the result is not to be returned, but instead an API call must be made to your favourite online random generator (e.g. https://qrng.anu.edu.au/API/api-demo.php) and a random number from this must be returned.

## Observations and challenges
- Dev has no experience with Unity
- How to get Unity?
- What tools are used for Unity development? (Visual Studio?)
- How to get started with a UI app and deploy to device?
- How to manage lifecycle, basic architecture, state? (Last AC requires state)
- Dev not experienced in algorithmic operations
- Definition of "stack calculatur" and "reverse polish notation"?
- Sounds like something that already exists. Use a packaged library?
- Unit testing considerations - external lib vs. self-built

## Immediate tasks
- Get Unity and tools
  - Downloaded Unity from https://unity.com/download
  - Created a Unity account
  - Installed Unity Editor via Unity Hub
  - Installed tools for Unity with Visual Studio Installer
- Research stack calculator and reverse polish notation
  - First hit on google explains it well: https://stevenpcurtis.medium.com/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation-using-a-stack-7c618c9f80c0

## Next steps
- Explore creating a 2D app in VS and UE
